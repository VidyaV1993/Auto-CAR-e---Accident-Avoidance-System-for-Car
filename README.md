# Auto'CAR'e - Accident Avoidance System for Car
This is basically a simple model of a driver friendly car which avoids accidents. It involves accident avoidance systems such as sleep alert system, alcohol detection system and collision avoidance system. Several sensors like MQ3 Gas sensor, IR sensor and Ultrasonic sensors were used and the implementation were done using TM4C123 Ti controller. More information is given in the report 'Accident Avoidance System-Report.pdf'.
